# Comparative analysis of different Predictive Models for Fouling factor prediction in Heat Exchanger
##In this project we are given with the shell and tube heat exchanger dataset and using different algorithms we are validating which is best suit.From the 6 months dataset next 1 month fouling will be predicted using LSTM and MLR model.

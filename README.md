# Comparative analysis of different Predictive Models for Fouling factor prediction in Heat Exchanger
### In this project we are given with the shell and tube heat exchanger dataset and using different algorithms we are validating which is best suit.From the 6 months dataset next 1 month fouling will be predicted using LSTM and MLR model.

## Models used for validation-
### 1.MLR(Multi-Linear Regression)
### 2.Random Forest Algorithm
### 3.RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
### 4.ANN (Advanced Neural Network)

## Models For Future Prediction
### 1.MLR(Multi-Linear Regression)
### 2.LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)
